# Hiring Metrics Dashboard Example

![ Use-case: Hiring Metrics dashboard ](./img/Hiring_Metrics_DashboardÂ _Nilefy.png)
In This example, I'll walk you through the steps to create a hiring metrics dashboard example using Nilefy. 

Before we start, what we are about to build is basically a tool to empower your HR teams, hiring managers, and senior leaders with an advanced hiring metrics dashboard that offers real-time insights into the recruitment process. Featuring a user-friendly interface to evaluate key metrics and automated tools for candidate communication, this dashboard streamlines your hiring workflow and accelerates the time-to-hire, making your recruitment efforts more efficient and effective.

## Let's start by building the database we're going to use

For this example I'm going to use postgres db and do the following: 
Step 1: Create the Database Schema

1. Create Tables: You'll need tables for applicants, applications, and possibly other related tables.
2. Define Columns: you'll need columns for name, email, phone number, years of experience, role applied for, location, resume link, status, etc.

### Step 1: Here is a basic SQL schema that you can use

``` sql
CREATE TABLE applicants (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    years_of_experience INT,
    role_applied_for VARCHAR(255),
    location VARCHAR(255),
    resume_link VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(50)
);

CREATE TABLE applications (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    applicant_id INT REFERENCES applicants(id),
    job_role VARCHAR(255),
    applied_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Step 2: Insert Sample Data

Insert some sample data to mimic the records

```sql
INSERT INTO applicants (name, email, phone, years_of_experience, role_applied_for, location, resume_link, status)
VALUES 
    ('Hilton Gemlett', 'hgemlett2q@istockphoto.com', '771-852-3905', 3, 'Marketing Lead', 'London', 'link_to_resume_1', 'Contacted'),
    ('Linus Petschelt', 'lpetschelt2p@indiatimes.com', '771-852-3906', 5, 'Software Engineer', 'Berlin', 'link_to_resume_2', 'Interviewed'),
    ('Friedrick Temp', 'ftempert2o@chrome.com', '771-852-3907', 2, 'Product Designer', 'New York', 'link_to_resume_3', 'Applied'),
    ('Calli Exton', 'cexton2n@google.com', '771-852-3908', 4, 'Product Designer', 'San Francisco', 'link_to_resume_4', 'Applied'),
    ('Berk Yurikov', 'byurikov2m@ucoz.com', '771-852-3909', 6, 'Software Engineer', 'London', 'link_to_resume_5', 'Interviewed'),
    ('Allie Whitchurch', 'awhitchurch2l@goo.gl', '771-852-3910', 1, 'Marketing Lead', 'Berlin', 'link_to_resume_6', 'Contacted'),
    ('Bentlee Versey', 'bversey2g@nature.com', '771-852-3933', 7, 'Software Engineer', 'San Francisco', 'link_to_resume_29', 'Interviewed'),
    ('Evan Lipsett', 'elipsett2f@cf2.com', '771-852-3934', 8, 'Product Designer', 'New York', 'link_to_resume_30', 'Applied'),
    ('Hilton Gemlett', 'hgemlett2q@istockphoto.com', '771-852-3935', 3, 'Marketing Lead', 'London', 'link_to_resume_31', 'Contacted'),
    ('Linus Petschelt', 'lpetschelt2p@indiatimes.com', '771-852-3936', 5, 'Software Engineer', 'Berlin', 'link_to_resume_32', 'Interviewed'),
    ('Friedrick Temp', 'ftempert2o@chrome.com', '771-852-3937', 2, 'Product Designer', 'New York', 'link_to_resume_33', 'Applied'),
    ('Calli Exton', 'cexton2n@google.com', '771-852-3938', 4, 'Product Designer', 'San Francisco', 'link_to_resume_34', 'Applied'),
    ('Berk Yurikov', 'byurikov2m@ucoz.com', '771-852-3939', 6, 'Software Engineer', 'London', 'link_to_resume_35', 'Interviewed'),
    ('Allie Whitchurch', 'awhitchurch2l@goo.gl', '771-852-3940', 1, 'Marketing Lead', 'Berlin', 'link_to_resume_36', 'Contacted'),
    ('Donall Quatrucci', 'dquatrucci2k@photobucket.com', '771-852-3941', 7, 'Product Designer', 'San Francisco', 'link_to_resume_37', 'Interviewed'),
    ('Patrick Bulbrook', 'pbulbrook2j@livejournal.com', '771-852-3942', 2, 'Software Engineer', 'New York', 'link_to_resume_38', 'Applied') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;

INSERT INTO applications (applicant_id, job_role)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Product Designer'),
    (2, 'Product Designer'),
    (3, 'Product Designer'),
    (4, 'Product Designer') ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;
```

### Step 3: Add (hiring_metrics)queries to count respective data

The way you do it is simple, you simply create a new query in our app paste the respective needed sql query. make sure to include it as a string inside 2 nested curly braces like so : `{{"SELECT * FROM applicants"}}`

![add query image](./img/add_query.png)
Here are a few sql queries that we're going to use:

1. Count Total Applications:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_applicants
FROM applicants;
```

1. Count Total Interviewed

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_interviewed
FROM applicants
WHERE status = 'Interviewed';
```

1. Count Total Contacted

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_contacted
FROM applicants
WHERE status = 'Contacted';
```

### Step 4: Create the table and view your data

Create a table by dragging and dropping it from the side menue
![Side Menue Table image](./img/side_menue_table.png)

To view the our records in the table first we need to create a query that would get all the applicants as seen in the picture:
![Get All Applicants image](./img/add_query.png)

to automatically generate the table headers and view the data inside our table, we need to pass the data generated by the query to the data field of the table properties:
![Table Data](./img/table_data.png)

Here is what the table should look like nowâš¡:
![Show Table image](./img/table_show.png)

notice I checked `RowSelection` from `table options` to make it selectible_

### Step 5: The Banner

Now we'll make use of the queries we generated earlier that count the total number of applicants, total interviewed, and total contacted.
Feel free to drag a container and give it a color to give the page a nice header at the top.
beneath it I'm going to go ahead and use another container for some background color. 
On top of that we're going to have 3 text fields to show these pieces of data one for each.
Here is what it might look like:
![banner png](./img/banner.png) 

I'm going to show you now how I could show the output of the query withing the text of the first text`Total Applicants: 10`
We simply include and access our query by it's id make sure to include any expressions -like our js here- inside 2 nested curly braces: `{{}}`
![total_applicants](./img/text_total_applicants.png)

### Step 6: showing selected row's data

That's nice, now we'd like to show an applicant's data when you select their respective row from the table.
By now you already know how to use a container for a background color and have text fields over it, feel free to do this now for their name, email, phone, etc..

now to show the selected row's data we simply access the table via its id _found in the side menue which is shown by clicking on the table_ then accessing the `selectedRow` property.

here is what the first field is going to look like:

![selected row](./img/selected_row.png)

Here is how mine looks like:
