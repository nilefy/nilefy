## Workspace Data Sources

Once a data source is connected to a workspace, the connection can be shared with any application of that workspace. Distinct connections can be associated with the same data source.

## Connecting Data Source

To connect a data source to your workspace: 

1. Within the **Data Sources** page, select the category (Databases, APIs, Cloud Storage, Plugins) to view the available data sources.
2. Click on the desired data source to add to the workspace.
3. To establish a connection, input the name of that connection (can be renamed) and the configuration details.

## Using Data Source

Once the connection is established, the data source will be acessible within the query panel of both existing applications and newly created ones.

1. Under the **Available Data Sources**, select the data source.
2. Now, you can create queries to the connected data source and switch between distinct connections associated with that data source.

## Disconnecting Data Source

You can disconnect a data source connection from the workspace or remove the data source with all its distinct connections.

## Data Queries

When a data source connection is selected to use, you can choose the query name and options to:
- Run query to this data source.
- Save this query to reuse. 
- Show all queries created to this connection within this application.
- Delete query.
- Update query.
and the query result can be accesed through the application.
